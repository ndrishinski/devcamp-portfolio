      <p>Since I was a young man growing up in Montana, my life consisted of two things: sports, and business. During the school year I would play sports and when it got warm out, I ran a yard care service in my small town. The operation grew to the point I first hired 1 employee, then 2 more. Because of these things I have learned to excel and grow from working and improving from other people in a team setting. My career then continued to doing sales for an insurance company. This was a fantastic learning opportunity where I grew to love self motivation, self help and many other key business components. I soon after pursued social media marketing and e-commerce sales online and built online stores through tools like Shopify and Wordpress. I enjoyed the challenge and science of sales-funnels and targeting shoppers, but I realized I wanted to learn to create these platforms and technologies myself. So I developed over 600 hours while attending Bottega Tech learning full stack and tested development. I'm excited to apply the things I've learned throughout my career to build better applications.
